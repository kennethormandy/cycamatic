cycamatic photobooth
====================

This is a collection of scripts that run the
[Cycamatic photobooth](https://lukecyca.com/2015/cycamatic-photobooth.html).

I use this repo as a backup and personal changelog. It isn't a polished project
ready for you to deploy, but it might be useful if you're building your own
photobooth. :)
